<blockquote> Happy Birthday to Me!

Today is my birthday, which gives all of my readers a wonderful chance to link to me and say nice things about me!


You all are so lucky to have this opportunity!


In keeping with my reverse aging methodology, today I am 25.


Yesterday was Gib's birthday, so you probably should say nice things about him to. Less nice than about me of course.</blockquote>
