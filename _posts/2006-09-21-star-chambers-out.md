I abhor any use of torture to gain information. By stooping to these base tactics, we are no better then those who we fight. America is supposedly a beacon of freedom in this dark world. Are we to become simply another thinly veiled totalitarian regime?


We are at a turning point in our history as a nation and as a world. Do we want to be friends with the world, or at war with the world. If we do aspire to rule the world, is it through military might or inclusive partnerships?


I cannot stress enough how strongly I am against us modifying the Geneva Convention for this 'war on terror'. Terror is not an army which we can meet on the battlefield and vanquish. It's a group of thuggish criminals who operate outside of the rules to gain an upper hand.


Treat them like the criminals they are, arrest them, jail them, but treat them fairly. As you would want to be treated were the circumstances reversed.


I urge you to <a href="http://action.downsizedc.org/wyc.php?cid=56">send a letter</a> to your congresscritter in regards to this issue.
