<blockquote>We are part of the whole which we call the universe, but it is an optical delusion of our mind that we think we are separate.

<p>This separateness is like a prison for us. Our job is to widen the circle of compassion so we feel connected to all people and all situations.</p>


<p>This terrible individualism must inevitably have an end</blockquote></p>
