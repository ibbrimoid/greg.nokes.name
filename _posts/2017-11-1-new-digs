So I went and did it - Moved to Jekyll and Markdown. Hosted on Heroku with a full development pipeline behind it. I love how easy it is to create a branch, work in that, and have my review app up and running for reviews. 


I also am attempting to do all development on my iPad now. With the keyboard it’s a reasonable platform for development. I also am playing around with code editors on the iPad. Currently i am using [https://workingcopyapp.com/](Working Copy by Anders Borum). We will see how it works out.
