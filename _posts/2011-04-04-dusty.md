If you notice some dust around here, I am working on getting some cool backend stuff set up. I'll blog about my experiences setting up:
<ul>
	<li> WP Supercache</li>
	<li>WP Supercache with a CDN</li>
	<li>CDN Sync</li>
	<li>Minification of JS/CSS files</li>
</ul>
I'm also going to be testing my current shared hosting vs a AWS Micro Instance. Given time, I might test Apache vs Nginx on the AWS instance.
