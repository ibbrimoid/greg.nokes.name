<blockquote>So in a democracy no one, however powerful or impotent, can have a right not to be insulted or offended. That principle is of particular importance in a nation that strives for racial and ethnic fairness.</blockquote>
-From <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18811">The Right to Ridicule</a> By <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/authors/90">Ronald Dworkin</a>

<p>I've never heard of this guy before, but he certainly has written a lot. I really like what he said in this article, however. Good read.</p>
