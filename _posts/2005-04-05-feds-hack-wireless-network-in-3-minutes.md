<blockquote>from the still-can't-balance-budget dept.
xs3 writes At a recent <span class="caps">ISSA</span> (Information Systems Security Association) meeting in Los Angeles, a team of <span class="caps">FBI</span> agents demonstrated current <span class="caps">WEP</span>-cracking techniques and broke a 128 bit <span class="caps">WEP</span> key in about three minutes. Special Agent Geoff Bickers ran the Powerpoint presentation and explained the attack, while the other agents (who did not want to be named or photographed) did the dirty work of sniffing wireless traffic and breaking the <span class="caps">WEP</span> keys. <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article111.php">This article</a> will be a general overview of the procedures used by the <span class="caps">FBI</span> team.</blockquote>
