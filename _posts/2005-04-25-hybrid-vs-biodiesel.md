	<blockquote>For example, hybrid cars, which even with the increased cost of oil don't make economic sense to buy. Purchasers will never realize in fuel savings the additional cost of the vehicle versus a comparable non-hybrid vehicle. Since the foundation of our economy is energy, I expect that the 'environmental savings' of a hybrid vehicle also does not equal out over it's lifetime. Hybrid cars cost more for a reason. They have extra parts and require additional steps in assembly. All of this translates pretty directly into having a higher energy cost to build and that correlates rather closely with needing more fossil fuel inputs and hence more pollution. </blockquote>

		<p>This is exactally why we need to look at the current crop of hybrids as testbeds for future techinology. When I have a choice between a Toyota Prius for 60k that gets 60mpg (1k per mpg) or a Volkswagen Jetta <span class="caps">TDI</span> for 22k that gets 50 mpg (thats .44k per mpg) which makes more sense?</p>
