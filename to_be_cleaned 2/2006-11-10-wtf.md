<p>During a telephone conference with reporters yesterday, outgoing Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin, while touting
	the new security features of Windows Vista, which was released to manufacturing yesterday, told a reporter that the
	system's new lockdown features are so capable and thorough that he was comfortable with his own seven-year-old
	son using Vista without antivirus software installed.</p>

<p>I run Antivirus software on my linux boxes and my Macs. First off, you cannot be too careful. Secondly, I do not want to be passing Virus infested file off on to anyone.</p>


<p>This has got to be just about the worst advice since 'Eat the Apple'.</p>
