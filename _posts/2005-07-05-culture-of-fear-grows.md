<a href="http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2005/07/you_dirty_pedop.html">Michael Hanscom</a> talks about an experience yesterday (July 4th 2005):


	<blockquote>I was having a good day wandering around Myrtle Edwards Park for the Fourth of Jul-Ivar's festivities until someone sicced the security goons on me. Apparently a parent had decided that since I was taking pictures of kids playing in the surf at one of the small beach areas, I was some creepy scumbag who had to be brought to heel.

	One security guy came up to me and pulled me aside, telling me that there had been complaints that I was taking pictures of children.</blockquote>

	Michael goes on to explain that he freely deleted the pictures of the clothed children playing in the public park, but was told that if he stayed, 'he would be watched'


	I think that Michael sums it up nicely with:


	<blockquote>Happy Fourth of July everyone. You know â€” independence, liberty, freedom, and civil rights and all that.</blockquote>

	This all comes back to the culture of fear that we live in. The media has us scared into thinking that we are in deathly fear for our lives, and crime and dismemberment are right around the corner.


	The statistics simply do not show this, however. If you read my <a href="http://greg.nokes.name/2004/10/19/politics-media-and-personal-safety/">earlier post</a>, you will see that crime is in fact <em>down</em> in the US. However, with the advent of global coverage - we see the few crimes that are committed spread sea to shining sea. We get daily, or hourly, updates on the fate of a missing girl in Aruba. While that is a very sad occurrence, how many people were in Aruba vacationing that weekend? What percentage were abducted? Does the media tell us  this? Or do they just focus on the fear that they can generate?


	That does not sell papers. Fear sells papers. Let's look at the war in Iraq. We are horrified that we have lost <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/casualties/">1746 people</a> in Iraq since the inception of hostilities on 3/19/03. That's 1% of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_orbat.htm">170,000</a> troops that we have on the ground. In '<a href="http://web1.whs.osd.mil/mmid/casualty/castop.htm">Nam</a> we lost 58,209 people, out of 2,594,000 serving. That's 2.2% losses. <a href="http://web1.whs.osd.mil/mmid/casualty/castop.htm">Korea</a> was worse - with 54,246 total deaths out of 1,789,000 on the ground. That's just over 3% dead. The world wars are even more grossly horrific. So, for being at war, we are doing pretty well.


	As an aside, 170,000 in Iraq is a very conservative estimate. I was looking for the total number of troops that have served in the theater, as the numbers from the rest of the conflicts are based on total numbers that served through the conflict not the highest force levels. I have found numbers in the 250,000 range, but none from really good sources. With the quarter million number, the <span class="caps">KIA</span> percentage is an even lower %1/2.


	However, the media plays what they want you to see up. They do not show reality in the true light, rather in what ever light sells more papers, and advances their agenda. The media no longer is impartial. They are trying to sell the public a bill of goods. "Stay at home - be afraid - listen to us and we will tell you about all of the horrible things out there!"


	So, you can hide behind your locked doors, looking out of the drawn curtains, or you can free yourself and go out into the world, safely, sanely and with the correct amount of precautions.
