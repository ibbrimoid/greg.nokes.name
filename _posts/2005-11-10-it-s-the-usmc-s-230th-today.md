It's the <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/"><span class="caps">USMC</span></a>'s 230th birthday today. I found this <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/holiday/usmc/2005_playmovie.asp?isc=gdg1110&#38;se=%2B">little</a> flash movie about it.


We do not always agree with the policys that send the Marines in, but with out them, the Army, Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard, we would not enjoy the freedoms that we do today.


<blockquote>Don't hit at all if it is honorably possible to avoid hitting; but never hit soft.</blockquote>

Here's to every one who ever served, is serving, or is going to serve.

Update: The <span class="caps">USMC</span>'s Birthday was yesterday (November 10th), however today is Veterans day in the US - A time to remember all those who helped and help us stay free.
