All of this Earth moving talk had me thinking back to <a href="http://www.analy.org/">High School</a>, where we once talked about how the moon might have formed. Since it has been a few decades (centuries?) since I was in High School, I decided to take a gander at the current thinking. I found several sites - most are just the same old theory, which is quite good.

<blockquote>At the time Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, other smaller planetary bodies were also growing. One of these hit earth late in Earth's growth process, blowing out rocky debris. A fraction of that debris went into orbit around the Earth and aggregated into the moon.</blockquote>

This theory (<a href="http://www.onlineuniversity.net/earth-science/origin-of-the-moon/">here</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Formation">here</a>) is pretty well though out. In 2001, there were some computer simulations done by the <a href="http://www.swri.org/">Southwest Research Institute</a> that showed this process working. They have posted <a href="http://63.114.151.211/release/2001/anim24n.wmv">video</a>, and <a href="http://www.swri.org/press/fig1biga.tif">pictures</a> <a href="http://www.swri.org/press/impact.htm">here</a>. <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/moonwhack_main_000901.html">Space.com</a> has a good article on this as well.
Interesting stuff.
