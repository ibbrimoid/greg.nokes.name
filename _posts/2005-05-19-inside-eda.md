	<blockquote>He asked many times to get married. I teased, I joked, I let him dream at times. Deep inside I knew, my heart knew that I got married long time ago to someone else.</blockquote>

	I know that feeling.


	I have been left in the dust, watching some one who I thought that I knew do what she had told me all along she would do to me.


	It still hurt.


	I am glad that it happened. With out that point in my life, I would not be who I am today.
