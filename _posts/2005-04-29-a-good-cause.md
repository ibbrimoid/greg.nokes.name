<p>My <a href="http://noctrine.blogspot.com">brother</a>, Nelson, is 'Riding for Aids'. This explains what this is all about:</p>


	<blockquote>Last June I participated in the <span class="caps">AIDS</span> LifeCycle 3 as a volunteer. Over 1200 riders pedaled the 585 mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles, raising $4.9 million dollars. I am registered as a rider for <span class="caps">AIDS</span> LifeCycle 4, and am committed to raising $2500 to participate in the ride. This money goes directly to the San Francisco <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Foundation to support people living with <span class="caps">HIV</span> and <span class="caps">AIDS</span> in the Bay Area. This foundation provides counseling, free or reduced-cost medications to individuals, public policy and advocacy, and much more.

		<p>You can find out more information about the <span class="caps">AIDS</span> LifeCycle and affiliated organizations on my fundraising website:</p>


		<p><a href="http://www.sonic.net/<sub>olofin"&gt;<em>http://www.sonic.net/</sub>olofin</em></a></p>


		<p>The site has answers to common questions, a training log, photos, and information on how to sponsor me in my ride to end <span class="caps">AIDS</span>.</p>


		<p>Donations of any size are greatly appreciated.</p>


		<p>Thank you for your support,</p>
