<p><a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu Linux</a> is looking for your help. Even if you do not use Linux for what ever reason, they want to know. They have posted a quick and easy <a href="http://surveys.geekosophical.net/">survey</a> for you to take about Operating Systems. Go - tell them what's wrong with Linux and let's give Microsoft a real competitor on the desktop!</p>


<p>Drop a line here with your thoughts on the survey and we will bat it about.</p>
