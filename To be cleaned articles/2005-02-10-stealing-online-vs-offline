<p>In a stunning study, <a href=http://offtheshelf.nowis.com/index.cfm?ID=5>Off the Shelf</a> muses about the diffrences between stealing a season of <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/">Alias</a> online vs offline. If you were to fire up <a href="http://bittorrent.com/">Bittorrent</a> and download it, you could be liable for up to $3,400,000, 1 year jail time, lawyer fees and Court Costs. So, if you were to slip on that ol' trench coat and saunter down to <a href="http://www.gohastings.com/catalog/">Hastings</a> and slip out with a copy of that, you could be liable for $100,000 and 1 year in jail.<br /><br />Just makes me wonder.</p>
