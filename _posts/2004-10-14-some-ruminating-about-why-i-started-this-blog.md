<p>Over the years, I have been less then perfect about keeping up with people. I am very <em>now</em> oriented, and seem to have a hard time remembering to keep in touch with friends and family from long ago or far away.</p>


	<p>I have never liked this about my self, and have often wished that I could do something about it. I have tried several times, setting up mailing lists and other thing-a-ma-jiggers, however for whatever reason, they never flew.</p>


	<p>So, here is my spot in cyberspace. Ya'll can drop on by and check up on me when ever you want. Please feel free to comment on things that I say. I crave feedback.</p>


	<p>On April 17th, 2004 I married Shela. I made a slide show of some of the digital pictures from before, during and after the wedding. You can view it <a href=http://www.nwgamers.org/wedding.asf>here!</a>. Some of the family has already seen it, but here it is in all of its glory for all of you.</p>


	<p>Quite honestly, Shela and I met during the end of a very dark time in my life. I had just ended a 10-year relationship and marriage on less then friendly terms, and was also reeling from a very hard breakup with some one that was very close to me. She was not ready for a committed relationship, but then again neither was I. I really hope that all of my ex's can find real, deep happiness. That is all that I have really ever wanted for them and me. I think that I have gotten there now and I hope that their journeys there are as swift as possible.</p>


	<p>Shela was like a ray of sunlight at the end of a long tunnel. When I met her, my whole life was starting on an upswing, and she helped me out so much. Her bubbly personality was, and is, just what I need. She also is just as stubborn as I am. We butt heads every once in a while, but that is just part of life. We are both strong personalities, and quite honestly, I would not have it any other way.</p>


	<p>Just about 11 weeks ago, Shela and I made a little Shela and Dukk. Now, a lot of you know me from my 'No Kids, Never No How' phase. Gladly (since one is on the way) I am actually looking forward to this. I think that it is going to be a rewarding experience.</p>


	<p>The pregnancy has been hard on Shela so far, she was on an IV at home for about 3 weeks. Happily, she is back at work now, and glad to be off the couch!</p>
