<blockquote>You should probably buy a shredder today.

	<p>I get a heck of a lot of credit card applications in the mail.
A bunch for Visa, quite a few from Mastercard and tons of them from American Express.</p>


	<p>I almost always tear them in half and throw them away.</p>


	<p>Sometimes, if I am feeling particularly paranoid, I'll tear them into little bitty pieces.</p>


	<p>Is that good enough?</blockquote></p>
