<p>Bruce Schneier has an interesting <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html">article</a> posted about real world password strength. He bases his findings off of a list of passwords recovered from a phishing attempt on MySpace. Well worth reading...</p>


<blockquote>How good are the passwords people are choosing to protect their computers and online accounts?

<p>It's a hard question to answer because data is scarce. But recently, a colleague sent me some spoils from a MySpace phishing attack: 34,000 actual user names and passwords.</p>


<p>The attack was pretty basic. The attackers created a fake MySpace login page, and collected login information when users thought they were accessing their own account on the site. The data was forwarded to various compromised web servers, where the attackers would harvest it later.</p>


<p>MySpace estimates that more than 100,000 people fell for the attack before it was shut down. The data I have is from two different collection points, and was cleaned of the small percentage of people who realized they were responding to a phishing attack. I analyzed the data, and this is what I learned.</blockquote></p>
