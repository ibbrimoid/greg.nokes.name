<blockquote>Given the forces of divisiveness and violence that have been unleashed in many parts of the world in recent years, I have been asked to explain what resources within Buddhism I draw upon as a Buddhist scholar and Dharma teacher that might help empower people in their quest for genuine peace.</blockquote>

<p>This <a href="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=7,1166,0,0,1,0">article</a> is a fantastic read, and a very good look at the ever escalating cycle of violence that we must break to bring real peace to this world.</p>


<p>This is one of the hardest things for me. There are some situations where the use of force is very justified - for example if my Son or Wife were to be attacked with deadly force, I would not hesitate to bring deadly force to the table in an attempt to make them safe. However, this is a slippery slope. Hatred and violence do breed more of the same.</p>


<p>This is one of the largest issues with which I wrestle as a Buddhist. There are historical examples of Buddhist sects and monks that employ violence in self defense. I think that in certain cases this is justifiable. These tactics need to be used with the utmost caution however, as it can further hatred. If anything, violence must be tempered with love and understanding.</p>
