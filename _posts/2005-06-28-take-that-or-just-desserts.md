<blockquote>Here is one way to fight back against the Kelo decision that took away your property rights. Logan Darrow Clements of Freestar Media, <span class="caps">LLC</span> anounced the attempted acquistion of Justice David H. Soute's home in Weare, New Hampshire. Plans for the property include a new hotel which constitutes better public use of the property than Mr. Souter's simple ownership.</blockquote>
