You can hang out with normal people or you can hang out with geeks which means you often have geeks as friends and/or have a job where you have to mediate between geeks and normal people. This is an important role and one of which you should be proud. In fact, you can make a good deal of money as a translator.<br /><blockquote><br /><b>Normal:</b> Tell our geek we need him to work this weekend.<br /><br /><br /><b>You [to Geek]:</b> We need more than that, Scotty. You'll have to stay until you can squeeze more outta them engines!<br /><br /><br /><b>Geek [to You]:</b> I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain, but we need more dilithium crystals!<br /><br /><br /><b>You [to Normal]:</b> He wants to know if he gets overtime.<br /><br /></blockquote></td></table> <a href="http://www.thudfactor.com/geekquiz.php">Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com</a>
