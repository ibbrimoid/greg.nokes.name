Saw Serenity over the weekend. Quite a ride. I had high hopes for this film, and except for a few very minor points that my over critical mind came up with, it was Fricken Fanstastic! :)


Also - there is a trailer for the next one in the chute - check it out <a href="http://www.mosquitoverse.com">here</a>
