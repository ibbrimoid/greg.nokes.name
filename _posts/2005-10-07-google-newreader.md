<p>I read a lot of <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds - and I have trying to find a tool that will help keep them all straight. The best reader that I have found is safari - it's included with my Mac, it does a good job and it's really straight forward.</p>


	<p>Enter <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/things/intro">Google</a>. Looks like they just might have another kewl tool in the wings. It's a bit slow right now, but I expect to see good things coming from this. And - in a google first - it works with Mac right out of the gate!</p>
