<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/06/eu_bins_swpat/">EU The Register</a> says:</p>


	<blockquote>The European Parliament has voted by a massive majority to reject the software patents directive, formally known as the Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions. The vote to scrap the bill was passed by a margin of 648 votes to 14, with 18 abstentions.</blockquote>
