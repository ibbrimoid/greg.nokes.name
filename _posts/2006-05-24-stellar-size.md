<p>Size some times really does matter.</p>


	<p>One of the things that I pass the time with is <a href="http://www.farfuture.net">Traveller</a>, especially <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/traveller/">G:Traveller</a>, and the new <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/traveller/interstellarwars/">G:Traveller Interstellar Wars</a>. 'Hard' Science fiction has always been a favorite read for me, and Traveller brought it to the gaming table. I think that I got my first Traveller book in '82. It's been a non-stop obsession ever since. I own a copy of the basic rules of every iteration of the game - Classic Traveller, Mega Traveller, Traveller: The New Era, Traveller 4, Gurps Traveller and Gurps Traveller 4th edition.</p>


	<p>So, I guess that you could call me a traveller geek!</p>


	<p>One of the basic technologies of Traveller is the Jump Drive. It allows you to leave 'normal space' at point A and emerge at point B in about a week. Depending on the ship, point B could be as much as 6 parsecs (18 light years) away. There are a few caveats, however. The most important is that you do not want to start or end your jump with in 100 diameters of a massive object. For some reason, stellar objects have been ignored in this calculation.</p>
