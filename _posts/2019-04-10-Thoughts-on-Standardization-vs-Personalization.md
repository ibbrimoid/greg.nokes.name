I was traveling for pleasure a few weeks ago, and I got into an interesting discussion with one of the people responsible for the experience we had on the trip. He posited that the most important thing a brand could do was to standardize the experience across all of their touch points.

I disagree.

While I agree that a consistent experience is very important, I feel like that is table stakes today for any sort of customer experience. What is more critical to get right these days is personalization.

For example, a hotel chain that I used to frequent knew that my favorite snack was wasabi peas. About half of the time that I arrived in my room, there was some wasabi peas waiting for me. That personal touch insured years of loyalty from me.

It's a simple idea, however the implementation is very hard. You have to have some sort of customer record where you can store these preferences, and insure that they are pushed out to everyone who needs to know about them almost in real time.

Modern customer facing companies that get this right will stand head and shoulders above the ones that just standardize on a common experience.

Imagine a world where my favorite restaurant chain already knew about my dairy allergy. When I ordered, that would be automatically taken into account, and the meal would be prepared correctly for me.

The technology to accomplish this is already here. Stitching it together, and learning about your customers is the harder part.
