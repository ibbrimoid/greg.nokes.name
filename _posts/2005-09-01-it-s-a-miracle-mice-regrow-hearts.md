<blockquote><span class="caps">SCIENTISTS</span> have created "miracle mice" that can regenerate amputated limbs or damaged vital organs, making them able to recover from injuries that would kill or permanently disable normal animals.

The experimental animals are unique among mammals in their ability to regrow their heart, toes, joints and tail.</blockquote>

We all know that 'mice today, people tomorrow'. Imagine the possiblities. Broken wrist that will never heal correctly? Chop it off, and let it regrow new.


It reminds me of a quote from Firefly.

Zoe: "We live in a space ship, dear."</blockquote>


We are truly living in a spaceship, dear.
