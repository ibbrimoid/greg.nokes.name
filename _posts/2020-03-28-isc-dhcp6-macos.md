One of the frustrations with my current WiFi setup is that the router is very inflexible. For example, it would not allow me to set the Domain Name servers that I wanted to use for my internal devices. It would only deliver the DNS servers that my internet provider delivered to it.

<!--more -->

Well, since I have set up may DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) servers in the past, I did not think this would be a problem. I have an older Mac that I could use, as it stays plugged into the network and is already operating as a Apple iCloud Cache.

I also wanted to be able to deliver IPv6 DNS servers to my machines as well.

Well, it was not quite as easy as I thought it was going to be. I had to learn how to use `launchctl` and `launchd`. I came from a background of using `init` and `systemd` so I assumed this would be fairly easy.

**Step 1**

I went ahead and installed the DHCP server via brew.

``
~ â˜¯ brew install isc-dhcp
``
