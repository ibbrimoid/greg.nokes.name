<p>Well, I have been using <span class="caps">RC1</span> of Open Office 2 for a few weeks now, and I just wanted to take some time to jot down some opinions.</p>


<p>The interface is much cleaner then the 1.x era of Open Office. I must say that I really like it. The buttons are sharp and clean, and colorful. In the menus, they display the button icons next to the command, so it makes finding things easier.</p>


<p>As far as stability, I have had no crashes with it at all. Considering this is a beta release, I am very happy with that. Still available is the <span class="caps">PDF</span> creator. The font wizard is pretty cool as well, allowing you to download and install <span class="caps">LGPL</span> fonts directly into Open Office.</p>


<p>It seems to do a better job of importing and exporting from the Microsoft Office file formats then the older version. Excel to Open office is still lacking , only in the artistic area. I like using drop shadows when I create forms in spreadsheets. Open office does not yet support that. It's a little feature, but one that I am looking forward to.</p>


	<pre><code>I currently am running it on Windows XP SP2. Due to some of the <a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/03/22/204244.shtml?tid=93">core features</a> being implemented in Java, however, getting it onto a Linux box might entail some work (installing the Java Runtime and then the Open Office package by hand), but that is work that I am going to do as soon as the full 2.o is out.</code></pre>
