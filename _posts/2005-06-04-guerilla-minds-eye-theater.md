Wabi my Sabi has a link to <a href="http://www.billboardliberation.com/ronald.html">this</a>. It is one of the most brilliant Guerilla Minds Eye Theater events that I have seen in a long time.


	As a Discordian, I feel that the event should not have had meaning at all.


	I do not agree with the agressive tone that some of these things have, for example I would not have invaded a resturant. It is enough to teach. Any time a person tries to block anyone else's choices - that is not freedom. People should be allowed to make stupid choices - but should be educated about the those choices.


	Really just rambling - did I make any sense?
