<blockquote><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1788008,00.asp">eWeek</a> reports: "The first reports from users installing Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 are in. And as was the case with its client counterpartâ€”Windows XP Service Pack 2â€”the latest <em>Windows Server service pack breaks several key Microsoft and third-party applications</em>. <span class="caps">SP1</span> (Service Pack 1) is primarily a security update. But as was the case with <span class="caps">XP SP2</span> (Service Pack 2), Windows Server 2003 <span class="caps">SP1</span> also will include some brand-new features."</blockquote>
