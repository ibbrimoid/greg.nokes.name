<blockquote>In the first story, Spokane police officers were unavailable to respond to a citizen observing and intervening in a felony in progress where the potential for violence was real. In the second story, Spokane police officers were available to be dispatched to investigate a "false alarm" at an unoccupied business, Anthony's Restaurant, a site favored by Spokane Mayor Jim West.</blockquote>
