<blockquote>Buddhism is not a religion because 'belief' in the Buddha's teachings is not blind belief, blind faith, and far from superstition. Shakyamuni Buddha taught us not to blindly believe what he tells us, he wants us to try the teachings and prove them for ourselves. The Buddha wants us to know, not merely believe.</blockquote>

<p>The difference between what Christianity teaches and what Buddhism teaches is vast - not only in theology, but also in philosophy. Christianity teaches us to have faith in it's teachings, and the book that they are based on. It's like Ice Cream manufactures telling us that Ice Cream is the best food ever, and all we should ever eat is Ice Cream.</p>


If you dare question, you are subject to many punishments. They range from burning at the stake in yesteryear to social and civic penalties today.
<blockquote>You shouldn't think something just because you believe it. You need reasons. That applies to religion. That applies to politics . . . just because your parents believe something isn't good enough.</blockquote>

As more and more people start to dig deeply into their Christian Faith, some are seeing that it is a house of cards. There is no historical evidence to support the Bible's claims. If people want to believe in Christianity, I have no problem with that - however I do have a problem when they tell me that the Bible is The Truth.
<blockquote>There are some 5,700 ancient Greek manuscripts that are the basis of the modern versions of the New Testament, and scholars have uncovered more than 200,000 differences in those texts.

<p>"Put it this way: There are more variances among our manuscripts than there are <em>words</em> in the New Testament," Ehrman summarizes.</blockquote>

<p>Here's a wake up call - truth is subjective. It depends on the circumstances. There is no universal truth that we have ever found. Your way might be right for you, but that does not give you the mandate to force your way on others! It does not give you the right to kill, imprison, maim, or ostracize those that have a different truth.</p>


<p>Words work - tell others why you believe this way, what evidence you have. Through discourse, ideas spread, and perhaps you will get more and more people to agree with you.</p>


<p>This does not work if you have no reasons to believe what you believe. This tension between a person's heartfelt belief and their lack of reason for that belief is what fosters radicalism.</p>


<p>"I cannot convince you that I am right because I have no evidence, so I am going to make it a law!" or kill, or whatever.</p>


<p>Well, you know what? If ya'll don't get more tolerant, I am going to pass laws to force ya'll to become good little Buddhists.</p>
