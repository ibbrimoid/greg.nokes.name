<blockquote>But Mr. Gibson withdrew whenever the discussions grew heated. And by not intervening more forcefully early on in the Republican debate, he allowed much of their discussion to remain staid and uninformative â€” <b>Representative Ron Paul, of all candidates, dominated the foreign policy debate.</b></blockquote>

	<p>The other Republican candidates seem out of touch with reality. Rudy Giuliani actually said that the past US Foreign policy had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. True, they were carried out by people with a choice; however our foreign policy in the region never has been one that thought of the people in the region. Rather we have sought outcomes which serve our interests, at the detriment of the people. And we wonder why the people of the Middle East dislike the United States. We have used these people for years as pawns in our grand game of world domination. And, now the bill for our misbehavior is coming due.</p>

            <p>This philosophy of a 'Just War' that has been bandied about for the last few years is deeply flawed. Any unprovoked aggressive action is not just. Bullets and Bombs do not spread democracy , they spread hate. Think about it this way. If Iran were to bomb us, invade us, occupy us and tell us that we had to install a Islamic government, how would we react?</p>


	<p>And yet, the warmongers in Washington keep bombing, invading and occupying other countries, and expecting them to suddenly become a 'democratic' country.  Or, we get an election, and if the people elected are not the ones we want, we take actions which harm the people on the street.</p>


	<p>A perfect example of this flawed policy is Palestine. They had a free and fair election. They elected the party that they believed in. We pulled all aid (which has been propping up their economy for decades). Their country crumbled; there were riots, civilian deaths, and street warfare. How is this fair? How does this engender the person on the street to the US?</p>


	<p>We simply have to stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. We need to stop propping up governments that are expedient to our short term aims, and start to truly spread freedom by example. We need to become world leaders again, instead of bullies.</p>


<blockquote> Whether the United States was trying to keep the shah of Iran in power or trying to prevent the rise of Arab nationalism and nonalignment, its policy was a blunt instrument applied presumptuously to subtle and complicated problems. One journalist has likened it to playing pool with a 20-foot cue stick. It would have been a miracle had the result not been chronic turmoil. The impracticality of the policy would have been a stumbling block even if the United States had not been on the side of injustice.</blockquote>

	<p>It's time to back away from brinkmanship and interventionist policy. It's clear that it has not worked , the last 50 years of history have show that beyond that a shadow of a doubt.  If we are to shake the image of a bully, and regain our good standing in the world, we must become a force for positivism rather then negativism.</p>
