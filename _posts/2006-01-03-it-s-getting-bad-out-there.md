<p>Check this out; There is a nasty nasty windows problem in the wild (a '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_exploit">Zero Day Exploit</a>'). This one is bad. Microsoft is not doing anything about it until next week. - So, check out my <a href="http://geek.nokes.name">Tech Blog</a> for a detailed how to on <a href="http://geek.nokes.name/archives/200">fixing this</a>.</p>


<p>This is totally serious, and could become a major problem.</p>
