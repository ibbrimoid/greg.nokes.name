<p><a href=http://www.osnews.com/editor.php?editors_id=1>Eugenia</a> posted an <a href=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9933>article</a> a few days ago, and then <a href=http://www.expert-zone.com/index.php?module=announce&#38;ANN_user_op=view&#38;ANN_id=750&#38;4ae6d70e6dc49027d85e12bb2dd15191=19155f6cc836bb9d8ed256cf68c4d5a9>another</a> was posted and the lists started up and another etc...<br /><br />The short and long of the entire thing is that Eugenia feels that F/OSS developers are not as open to feature requests as Commerical developers. I tend to agree with her. F/OSS developers tend to 'scratch their itches' and not mine or yours. They are not paid for their efforts after all.<br /><br />If you want a customer centeric experince, look into customer driven software. One where the developers have a vested intrest in developing for their clients. <a href=http://www.kde.org><span class="caps">KDE</span></a> and <a href=http://www.gnome.org>Gnome</a> are good examples. Many of <span class="caps">KDE</span>'s developers are employed by <a href=http://www.suse.com>SuSE</a> and <a href=http://www.novell.com>Novell</a>. Many Gnome devlopers are employed by Novell and <a href=http://www.canonical.com/>Canonical</a>.<br /><br />But, wait, those are F/OSS software, right? Right!<br /><br />Most major F/OSS projects are sponsored by large, paying companies. If you support those companies, you support those projects. You gain a more powerful voice with the project to see your goals met.<br /><br />So, the moral of the story is as follows. If you love using F/OSS software, and are happy with it, great. Support the companies that support the software, or donate.<br /><br />If some very important feature is missing, add it yourself, or support one of the companies, and tell them what you want.<br /><br />As an aside, <a href=http://www.theopencd.org/>The Open CD</a> is a good thing. Go, download it and check it out. Some really cool F/OSS software for windows there. Go - get it!<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>
