<p><a href="http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/archive/2005/08/15/grilledCheeseSheehan.aspx">SaaM</a> has this to say about Cindy:</p>


	<blockquote>Crawford Tx. , Thousands of people gathered today to try to catch a glimpse of a grilled cheese sandwich that supposedly sported the likeness of Mother Sheehan, the Patron Saint of Left Causes. Mrs. Sheehan is grieving her lost son Casey, who was killed in combat after apparently being forced to volunteer for military duty, and currently camping near President Bush's vacation ranch to protest the war. Grilled to perfectionMrs. Sheehan was recently bestowed the highest honor the Left can give: Victim. </blockquote>
