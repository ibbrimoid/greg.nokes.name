<p>There is a good <a href="http://www.2cpu.com/articles/113_1.html">Home Theatre PC Guide</a> out there. What they talk about is how to build a Home Theater PC - more then  just a <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVO</a>. You will be able to record TV to a digital format, display photos, play your Sound Files. It is a one stop shop.</p>


<p>I think that I am going to build one some day. I have a few old PC's that need a home :)</p>
