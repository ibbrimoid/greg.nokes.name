<a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/2005/05/beyond-red-and-blue.html">Dave</a> has a link to an intresting political survey - here are my results:


	<blockquote>Upbeat

	Based on your answers to the questionnaire, you most closely resemble survey respondents within the Upbeat typology group. This does not mean that you necessarily fit every group characteristic or agree with the group on all issues.


	Upbeats represent 11 percent of the American public, and 13 percent of registered voters.


	Basic Description
	Upbeats express positive views about the economy, government and society. Satisfied with their own financial situation and the direction the nation is heading, these voters support George W. Bush's leadership in economic matters more than on social or foreign policy issues. Combining highly favorable views of government with equally positive views of business and the marketplace, Upbeats believe that success is in people's own hands, and that businesses make a positive contribution to society. This group also has a very favorable view of immigrants.


	Defining Values
	Very favorable views of government performance and responsiveness defines the group, along with similarly positive outlook on the role of business in society. While most support the war in Iraq, Upbeats have mixed views on foreign policy , but most favor preemptive military action against countries that threaten the U.S. Religious, but decidedly moderate in views about social and cultural issues.


	Who They Are
	Relatively young (26% are under 30) and well-educated, Upbeats are the second wealthiest group after Enterprisers (39% have household incomes of $75,000 or more). The highest proportion of Catholics (30%) and white mainline Protestants (28%) of all groups, although fewer than half (46%) attend church weekly. Mostly white (87%), suburban, and married, they are evenly split between men and women.


	Lifestyle Notes
	High rate of stock ownership (42%, 2nd after Enterprisers).


	2004 Election
	Bush 63%, Kerry 14%.


	Party ID
	56% Independent/No Preference, 39% Republican, 5% Democrat (73% Rep/LeanRep)


	Media Use
	Upbeats are second only to Liberals in citing the internet as their main news source (34% compared with 23% nationwide); 46% also cite newspapers. No more or less engaged in politics than the national average. </blockquote>
