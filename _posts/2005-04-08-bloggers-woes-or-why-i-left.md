<a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> is having major issues.


I had my blog over there for quite a while, and honestly, I liked it. It was simple, effective and all in all a good thing.


But <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> has grown too fast. They are having serious preformance issues. The commenting system crashes. There are no ping/trackbacks. They post <em>"it's a free service, don't complain"</em>. If I could have signed up for a pay account that actually worked, I would have. I really liked their software (except the trackback issue). I hated the cronic slowness and other problems.


So, I got <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.


I put the problems squarely in the lap of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger.</a> They are now <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml">owned</a> by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google.</a> Why not add a few hundred servers? Why not charge for premium accounts, and funnel that money back into expansion?


Excuses aside, they are providing a service. If they expect to keep their good name, the service needs to meet expectations. If it does not, people will not use their service.


Here's to hoping that <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> will get it together and fix their issues - they have done a lot to advance blogging, and they could become a force to be reckoned with in the blogosphere. Heres hoping that they come back in full force.
