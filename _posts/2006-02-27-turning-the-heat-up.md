<blockquote>Feb. 21, 2006 â€” A new study of the Arctic permafrost forecasts that global warming will thaw and shrink the total area of perennially frozen ground 60 to 90 percent by 2100.</blockquote>

Are we approaching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point">tipping point</a>, or are we past it?
<blockquote>If true, it will...lead to the release by soils of vast doses of greenhouse gases, and upset ecosystems over wide areas</blockquote>

<p>Where would these greenhouse gasses come from? How about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia#Geography_and_geology">Siberia</a>? A large portion of Siberia is made up of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histels"><strong>Histels</strong></a>, "<em>which are  organic soils that have permafrost within 2 meters below ground surface. They have 80 % or more organic materials from the soil surface to a depth of 50 cm or to a glacic layer or densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallowest.</em>"</p>


<p>What does that mean? There is lots of frozen organic mush in the ground up there. If that were to thaw, we would see a methane plume hit the air which could cause more thawing, which would cause...</p>


<p>You get the picture.</p>


<p>Honestly, I do not know if <a href="http://foreven.com/libdat/libdat/h/Humaniti.htm">Humaniti</a> is to blame or not, or if we can even stop it. However, we need to be forearmed. Massive environmental change is not uncertain - it will happen, and is happening around us right now. Sort of like a massive impact scenario. It's gonna happen folks. The question is if we will be prepared.</p>
