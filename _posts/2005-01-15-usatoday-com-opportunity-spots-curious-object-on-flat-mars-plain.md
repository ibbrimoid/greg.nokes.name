[USATODAY](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-01-14-oppty-object_x.htm?csp=34):

    Opportunity spots curious object on flat Mars plain - NASA's Opportunity Mars rover has come across an interesting object â€” perhaps a meteorite sitting out in the open at Meridiani Planum. Initial data taken by the robot's Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) is suggestive that the odd-looking "rock" is made of metal.

It's just amazing that this probe is still doing good science like this. A fantasic investment for the world made by the USA

It's incredible - in the same week we land a probe on Titan - one of the more likely objects to have an 'interesting' surface, and a really old probe finds a 'strange' thing just lying about on Mars.

There should be some really intresting news coming out of NASA over the next few months.
