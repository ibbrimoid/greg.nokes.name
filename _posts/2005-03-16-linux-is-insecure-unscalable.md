<p>According to the <a href="http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/">Agility Alliance</a>, <br /><br /><blockquote>From a corporate perspective, we are not confident where Linux is right now today. A large enterprise needs to be sure because it relates to securifying [sic] the environment. We see some of the same things occurring that did to Unix <del>- it could splinter into many different types of languages. We are quite cautious about Linux and its deployment</blockquote><br /><br />and<br /><br /><blockquote>We are concerned about security on an open standard environment like that. We are also concerned about some of the scalability issues that we are seeing on our clients on a global basis. Also, we are somewhat cautious about what happened with Unix , it splintered into eight applications -</del> until McNealy (Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun) finally announced he won the battle and had the one surviving Unix out there. We think Linux has the possibility of going the same route</blockquote><br /><br />and<br /><br /><blockquote>If you test Red Hat against Solaris 10 against whatever elseâ€¦ we would say that Solaris 10 beats it hands down on functionality and everything else</blockquote><br /><br />(all from <a href=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/0,2000061733,39184795,00.htm>this</a> article ad ZDNet)<br /><br />So, these guys are saying that Linux is not scaleable, and insecure, and we should use <a href=http://www.sun.com>Sun</a>'s <a href=http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp>Solaris</a> instead.<br /><br />I found it funny that the Members of this "<a href=http://www.eds.com/services/alliances/agility/>Agility Alliance" include <a href=http://www.sun.com>Sun</a> and <a href=http://www.microsoft.com>Microsoft</a>, both companies that would profit greatly from the demise of Linux.<br /><br />I also found it funny to find the following article just two above on <a href=http://www.osnews.com>OSNews</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>The homegrown Linux operating system has come a long way from its origins as a college kid's pet project and computer hobbyist favorite. Refined in recent years by professional computer programmers at <span class="caps">IBM</span>, Hewlett-Packard, Novell and Red Hat, Linux now has become so technically powerful that it lays claim to a prestigious title-<a href=http://www.forbes.com/home/enterprisetech/2005/03/15/cz_dl_0315linux.html>it runs more</a> of the world's top supercomputers than any other OS.</blockquote><br /><br />Also - guys, Sun does not own Unix. There are several flavors of Unix still out there - <span class="caps">AIX</span>, HP/UX, <span class="caps">BSD</span> and (shudders) <span class="caps">SCO</span> to name a few..<br /><br />Get your facts "straightified" before you start to pop off with stuff like this. <br /><br />So - who we gonna trust? Sun and Microsoft or Forbes?<br /><br />-Tsyko</p>
