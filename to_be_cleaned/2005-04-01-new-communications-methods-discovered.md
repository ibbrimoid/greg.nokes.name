<p>From <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/01/1417218&#38;from=rss">Slashdot</a>..</p>


<blockquote>Odin's Raven writes "Opera Software's R-and-D department today announced the discovery of a new technology dubbed 'Opera SoundWave' - a platform-independent speech solution for short- and medium-range interpersonal communication. Based on open standards, Opera's patent-pending <span class="caps">P2P</span> speech technology uses analogue signals carried through open air, enabling users to communicate in real- time without the use of computers or mobile phones. Details (including link to tech preview) are available in their press release. I wonder how long it will be before a <span class="caps">FOSS</span> implementation of this technology emerges?"</blockquote>

<p>Wow. that sounds really cool. I think that it could totally change the world, the way that we communicate and everything else. I think this is going to be big...</p>
