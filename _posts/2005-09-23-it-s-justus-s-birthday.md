<blockquote> Happy Birthday to Me!

	<p>Today is my birthday, which gives all of my readers a wonderful chance to link to me and say nice things about me!</p>


	<p>You all are so lucky to have this opportunity!</p>


	<p>In keeping with my reverse aging methodology, today I am 25.</p>


	<p>Yesterday was Gib's birthday, so you probably should say nice things about him to. Less nice than about me of course.</blockquote></p>
