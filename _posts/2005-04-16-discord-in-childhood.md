	<center><em><span class="caps">OUTSIDE</span> the house an ash-tree hung its terrible whips,
	And at night when the wind arose, the lash of the tree
	Shrieked and slashed the wind, as a ship's
	Weird rigging in a storm shrieks hideously.
	<br />Within the house two voices arose in anger, a slender lash
	Whistling delirious rage, and the dreadful sound
	Of a thick lash booming and bruising, until it drowned
	The other voice in a silence of blood, 'neath the noise of the ash.</em></center><br />
