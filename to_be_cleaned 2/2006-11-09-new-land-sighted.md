<p>The Pacific Ocean has given birth to a new volcanic island near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=tonga&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;z=7&#38;t=k&#38;om=1">Tonga</a>, according to ocean-going eyewitnesses.</p>


<p>Crew on board a yacht called the "Maiken" believed they were the first to see a volcanic island forming a day out
	from Neiafu, Tonga, while sailing towards Fiji in August, the Matangi Tonga news website reported Wednesday.</p>
