<blockquote>Now I have another question for the believers. And by the way, I'm genuinely curious. I don't do this just to stir up things, although that's fun too. I actually wonder how you think. My question is this: How do you explain to yourself that 4 billion people (minimum) believe different from you?

<p>These are the only reasons I can imagine. Pick one or tell me what I missed.</blockquote>
