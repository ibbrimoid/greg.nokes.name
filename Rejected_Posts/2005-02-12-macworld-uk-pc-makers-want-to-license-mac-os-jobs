<a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?RSS&amp;NewsID=10827">Macworld UK - PC makers want to license Mac OS</a><br /><br /><blockquote><i>"Apple has to fight off three of the biggest PC companies, sick of the security bugs that plague Windows, wanting to license the Mac operating system.<br /><br />The revelation came in a <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1025093,00.html">Fortune </a> magazine interview with Apple <span class="caps">CEO</span> Steve Jobs, described by <a href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/4950/">MacDailyNews</a> as 'an embarrassment of riches' because it is so full of information."</i></blockquote><br /><br />Sounds like a really good idea to me. There would be some technical issues at first, however I think that with a <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx>Hardware Compablity List</a> (like so many other vendors have published) it would be a good thing.<br /><br />Apple hardware would still be superior - the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC>PowerPC</a> chips are better then Intel/AMD's, and Apple has the market cornered on Cool.<br /><br />-Tsyko
