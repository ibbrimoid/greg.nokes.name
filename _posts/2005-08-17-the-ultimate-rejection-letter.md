Herbert A. Millington
	Chair - Search Committee

	College Hill, <span class="caps">MA  34109</span>


	Dear Professor Millington,


	Thank you for your letter of March 16.  After careful consideration, I
	regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me
	an assistant professor position in your department.


	This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually
	large number of rejection letters.  With such a varied and promising field
	of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.


	Despite Whitson's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in
	rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at
	this time.  Therefore, I will assume the position of assistant professor
	in your department this August.  I look forward to seeing you then.


	Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.


	Sincerely,
	Chris L. Jensen
