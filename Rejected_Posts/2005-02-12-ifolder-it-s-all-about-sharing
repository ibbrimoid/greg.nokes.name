One of the things that I am working on is <a href="http://www.ifolder.com/">iFolder</a>. It is a cool techonology, and has many applications at my work - not to mention neato things at home when combined with with <a href=http://www.openssl.org><span class="caps">SSL</span></a> or a <a href=http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/VPN-HOWTO><span class="caps">VPN</span></a>. I forsee a bunch of work on this as soon as it bubbles to the top of the Queue. And, it's not a Apple Product. :)<br /><br />-Tsyko
