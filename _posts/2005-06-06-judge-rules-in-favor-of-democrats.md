<blockquote><span class="caps">WENATCHEE</span> , A Chelan County Superior Court judge today said that despite evidence of numerous election errors, Republicans failed to prove those errors cost their candidate the race.

	Gov. Christine Gregoire's narrow win over Republican Dino Rossi stands, the judge ruled.


	'Irregularity ... is not sufficient to invalidate an election,â€ Judge John Bridges said, who was flanked by two sheriff's deputies as he read his lengthy ruling.


	There is no evidence that ballots were changed or that, as Republicans maintained, ballot boxes were 'stuffed,â€ he explained. 'Unless an election is clearly invalid, when the people have spoken, their verdict should not be disturbed by the courts,â€ he added.  </blockquote>
