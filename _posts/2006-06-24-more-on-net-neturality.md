<blockquote>Net neutrality is this:

<code>If I pay to connect to the Net with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or greater quality of service, then we can communicate at that level.</code>

That's all. Its up to the ISPs to make sure they interoperate so that that happens.
Net Neutrality is <span class="caps">NOT</span> asking for the internet for free.


Net Neutrality is <span class="caps">NOT</span> saying that one shouldn't pay more money for high quality of service. We always have, and we always will</blockquote>
