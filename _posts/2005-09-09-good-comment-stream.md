<blockquote> Who can we blame for building levies that were designed to withstand a cat 3 storm? Who can we blame for sending a cat 5 storm?

Let's fire God. If you want to push the blame up, and fire the guy who is really responsible, well, God let all of this happen right?


God must be evil.


All of this blame and firing crap is just stupid, as the previous few paragraphs tried to point out. Bush is not an evil person. Clinton was (is) not evil. I disagreed with his handling of a lot of things (Somalia, the Balkans, Cigars) however, I did not, and do not, think that he was the devil. When I got the chance, I voted my feelings, and lost (he got a second term). I accepted that. I am a grownup - I know that I do not always get my way.</blockquote>
