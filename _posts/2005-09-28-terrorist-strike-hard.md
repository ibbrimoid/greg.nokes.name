<p>Luckly this was just in a game - but this poses an intresting thought. In game, terrorists took a plague and spread it all over. I don't know if the terrorists had any agenda besides death and destruction, but what if they had? Could you threaten a <span class="caps">MMOG</span> publisher with acts of in game terror to get some change made? Could they hold you responsible for acts of in game terror?</p>
