<p>I really think that the evidence is mounting which shows that Evolution is the theory that best explains our origins. We are reaching the point where to believe in Intelligent Design or Creationism is hard to justify.</p>

	school boy who said, Faith is believing what you know ain't so.</p>

<p>I understand how hard it can be to release concepts that one is attached to. As we 'build our faith' in something, we allow it to become almost part of us. We are bound to it, and when it is challenged, it can actually cause us harm. Even Christianity talks about this. '<i>Let go, let God</i>' comes to mind.</p>


<p>To state 'This is what I believe' is a wonderful thing. To then never budge from that belief when presented with evidence, empirical or logical, which refutes that belief is closed minded. Our paradigm or world view is colored by all of our experiences. It is safe to say that we are not the same person that we were a day ago, or even 5 minutes ago. Each experience that we have changes our core being in ways that we cannot fathom. To say 'This I Believe now and forever' is to stay a caterpillar, never transcending into the next state of being.</p>


<blockquote> The Buddhist texts refer to four strands of grasping (<em>upaadaana</em>): grasping of sense pleasures (<em>kaamupaadaana</em>), <strong>of views (<em>di.t.thuupaadaana</em>), of rule and custom (<em>siilabbatupaadaana</em>), of doctrines of self (<em>attavaadupaadaana</em>).</strong> All of these can also be described as forms of <em>raaga</em> or desire. To destroy their power over the human psyche, attachment to them must be transformed into non-attachment. Non-attachment or non-grasping would therefore flow from the awareness that no possession, no relationship, no achievement is permanent or able to give lasting satisfaction; from the discovery that there is no self which needs to be protected, promoted, or defended; and from the realization that searching for selfish sensual gratification is pointless, since it leads only to craving and obsession.</blockquote>

<p>I think that it is like having a rope tied to yourself and a big horse. That horse is traveling away from you at a steady, but slow rate. When you are 'grasping', you firmly plant you're feet and refuse to budge. This will be fine for a time, but when the pressure builds, it starts to become painful. As the rope tightens, your fists start to get crushed, and your torso squeezed.</p>


<p>Would it not be much better to simply give in to the change, and walk with the horse?</p>
