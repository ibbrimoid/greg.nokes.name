I just wrote a <em>most excellent</em> article on Internet Explorer's security over at the <a href="http://geek.nokes.name/2005/12/27/microsoft-ie-unsafe/">Geek's Grotto</a>. If you are still using IE, you might want to check it out. It includes a link to a browser security check site that seems to be pretty darn good.
