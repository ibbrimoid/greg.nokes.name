So, with this <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/11/29/rails-2-0-release-candidate-2">article</a>, Rails 2.0 is almost on us.


I am starting a new F/OSS project as basically the lead developer (until we get some one better). I had about 2 or 3 hours of work into it, found this article, and decided to scrap all of the work and build with rails 2.


I plan on documenting the changes and cool things that I find here...
