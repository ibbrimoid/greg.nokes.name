People ask me why I keep this site up and running - and have for so long. I don’t think it’s about ego - it’s more like a snapshot of who I am each time I sit down to write. Everything changes, all the time. We die each second, and are reborn as someone new. The ability to look backwards, and see who I was a week, a month or a year ago is an interesting exercise in self examination.

And, I look back at the people all over the world whose lives have touched mine, and I am truly thankful to be living in a time of such ubiquitous communication. Democracy, peace and freedom are fostered by discourse. As long as we keep talking, everything will turn out ok…
