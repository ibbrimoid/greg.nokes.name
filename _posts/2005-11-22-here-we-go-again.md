<blockquote>Exploit code for a critical flaw in fully patched versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer browser has been released on the Internet, putting millions of Web surfers at risk of computer hijack attacks.

	<p>The zero-day exploit, posted by a U.K.-based group called "Computer Terrorism," could allow a remote hacker to take complete control of a Windows system if the victim simply browses to a malicious Web site.</p>


	<p>Ziff Davis Internet News have verified that the exploit works on fully patched Windows XP systems with default IE installations...</p>


	<p>...The group that published the exploit said Microsoft has been aware of the Javascript Window() vulnerability for several months but was mistakenly treating it as a low-priority denial-of-service flaw.</p>


	<p>Benjamin Tobias Franz, a German security researcher, originally published an advisory in May this year to warn of the denial-of-service bug.</blockquote></p>

	<p>You know the mantra.</p>


	<p>Switch to another <a href="http://www.browsehappy.com">browser</a>. Practice safe computing. Keep the scanners and firewalls on high alert. Or, switch to <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Linux</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com">Mac.</a></p>
