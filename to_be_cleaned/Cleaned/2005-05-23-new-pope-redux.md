<p>There is an intresting <a href="http://www.uscatholic.org/2005/06/dietmarmieth.pdf">article</a> over at <a href="http://www.uscatholic.org/">US Catholic</a> about the biography of the New Pope. It seems that he was at one time rather progressive - and it details his change towards conservatism. A good read - and one that is rather optimistic about Pope Benedict and the future of the Church. After reading this, I have higher hopes for the direction of the Catholic Church in the next few years.</p>
