Spamroll has a good <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/04/the_apple_virus.php">article,</a> that I am going to repost here for my readers..


	<blockquote>The <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/21/apples_big_virus/">Register</a> just posted this piece on Apple <span class="caps">OS X</span>, and attempts to find a correlation between the recent proliferation of computer security issues, and Apple's exploding <span class="caps">OS X</span> platform sales.

	I have touted Apple as a solution for the malware that binds us, <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/04/spyware_purveyo.php">over</a> and <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/03/how_to_really_h.php">over</a> and <a href="http://www.spamroll.com/blogarch/2005/03/spyware_legisla_1.php">over,</a> not because I am a "Mac-head," but because I bought one out of curiousity, and found it just plain works (and without all the nasties I became accustomed to with Windows).


	I have to agree with The Register - there is a correlation.


	If you are fed up, and are ready to make the jump, just click here: <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=rWSLPQplAy0&#38;offerid=77305.10000493&#38;type=3&#38;subid=0">Apple Store</a>.</blockquote>


	I have posted about this as well. Apples are great machines, and just about any alternate OS is going to be more secure then Windows.
