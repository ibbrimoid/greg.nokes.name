<p>According to <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1210067,00.asp">Dvorak</a>:</p>


<blockquote>I think that when we put all the numbers together, we can estimate that there are a minimum of 30 billion Windows system crashes a year.</blockquote>

<p>Read the article - it has some really good points - like 30 billion is the number of stars in the Milky Way.</p>


<p>Why do people take this?</p>


<blockquote>Gates said that 5 percent of Windows machines crash, on average, twice daily.</blockquote>

<p>And yet people still run out to buy it. It's like this:</p>


<p>I go and buy a <a href="http://www.vw.com/passat/index.html">Car</a>. But I have to pay extra for the Tires, the Paint, the Keys (and locks). When you buy a Windows computer - what do you do? You run out and buy <a href="http://www.antivirus.com">Anti-Virus</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">Office</a>, <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/">Firewalls</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=321CD7A2-6A57-4C57-A8BD-DBF62EDA9671&#38;displaylang=en">spyware killers</a>. You download and install a host of third party apps (<a href="<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">FireFox, thunderbird</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">Open Office</a>) because the ones that come with Windows are, well, less the perfect (Wordpad, anyone?). You get the <a href="http://desktop.google.com/?promo=mp-gds-v1-1">Google Desktop</a> so that you can efficiently search your machine, you get a <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">pop-up-blocker</a>, you spend about 6 hours running <a href="http://update.microsoft.com">updates</a>.</p>


<p>Oh - and by the way - half of the features that were going to be added to Windows Vista, well, they had to <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/08/27/HNlonghornadvances_1.html">drop</a> them because they did not think that they could get them working by '06 or '07.</p>


<p>It's like selling a car with out the tires, locks, keys, and paint. We would not stand for that - any car dealership that tried that would be drummed right into Chapter 13. And yet, some of us expect it from our computer stores.</p>


<p>And don't forget that all of this downloading has to be done quick. The average time a vanilla windows box can be connected to the internet with out being compromised is up to a record <a href="http://blogs.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2005/06/windows_surviva.html">40 minutes</a>. I want to trust my business and money to this OS, don't you?</p>
