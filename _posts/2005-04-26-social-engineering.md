The <a href="http://geekwitha45.blogspot.com/2005_04_17_geekwitha45_archive.html#111430965367547420"> GeekWithA.45</a> talks about his run in with Best Buy:


	<blockquote>Here's a rough transcript of my interaction with the cashier &#38; subsequent managers:

	Chipper Teenage Cashier Girl: "May I have your phone number?"


	This is common enough at a lot of places. Retailers want keys to link together purchases, and can mine a lot of information on buying trends and purchase patterns if they can define a household in a granular manner. This is also the purpose behind most grocery store discount cards. For the most part, this is a fairly benign activity, requiring the voluntary cooperation of the consumer. It's also an activity that I routinely decline to participate in.


	Me {out of long habit}: "Nope. I don't give that out."


	<span class="caps">CTCG</span>: "Uh...the cash register says I have to get your address for this product."


	Me: {knowing that satellite radio needs a subscription, and thinking this would set me up on the spot} Ok, That's G-e-e-k W-i-t-h...uh, this signs me for the subscription, right?


	<span class="caps">CTCG</span>: "Uh, no, it's just for our records..."


	Me: {a slight frost creeping into my voice} "Then you don't need it."</blockquote>


	Hmm.. here is an easier method. Find the phone number for Best Buy. Give them that one. Works great, and has the added benifit of messing with their systems.


	The poor, undertrained teenyboppers that work at these places do not make the rules - so just give them what they think they need and move on. :)
