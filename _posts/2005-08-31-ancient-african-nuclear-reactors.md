<p>It turns out that 16 nuclear reactors were discovered in <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap021016.html">Oklo, Africa</a>. The surprising part is that they are from 2 <strong>billion</strong> years ago.</p>


	<p>That is not a typo.</p>


	<p>They have come up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklo">theories</a> showing how they might have formed naturally - but come on.</p>


	<p>Our recorded history only stretches back a few thousand years. From what we can glean looking at old fossils and such, we have been around for a few hundred thousand years.</p>


	<p>Who is to say what came before us? Our racial lifespan is like the blink of an eye in the life of this planet. What blinks have come before us? What blinks will come after?</p>


	<p>What traces of us will be there in 2 billion years?</p>
