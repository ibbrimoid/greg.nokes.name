<p>I have have a couple of things published on Web App Scaling in the recent past. Here is a list:</p>

<ol>

<li><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/a-quick-primer-on-sharding-for-ruby-on-rails/">A Quick Primer On Sharding For Ruby On Rails</a>: I discuss application sharding techniques at a very high level.</li>

<li><del datetime="2009-07-04T22:08:03+00:00"><a href="http://railslab.newrelic.com/2009/02/04/greg-nokes-lead-technical-account-manager-engine-yard">Masters Interview at New Relic</a>: I talk about all kinds of scaling concepts</del>.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/docs/EY_Filesystem_Sharding_Tactics_and_Processes.pdf">Filesystem Sharding Tactics and Processes</a>: A look at how to shard filesystems. Many of the ideas can be used for sharding just about anything.</li>

</ol>

<p>For those that do not know. I'd like to take a second and define sharding - even though I did not invent the term.  Sharding is taking a system and breaking it up into smaller pieces, each with their own dedicated resources, to improve performance. It's that simple.</p>

<p>Anyways, enjoy!</p>
