<blockquote>New Intel <span class="caps">CEO</span> Paul Otellini has flashed a level of marketing savvy unseen with his predecessor by making the unusual suggestion that consumers by Apple's Mac computers if they wish to avoid immediate security risks.

	<p>Confused? You're not alone. Otellini had attendees of a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Carlsbad, California scratching their silicon this week, as they puzzled through his pro-Mac statements. The paper recounts the episode as follows;</p>


		<pre><code>Pressed about security by (a reporter), Mr Otellini had a startling confession: He spends an hour a weekend removing spyware from his daughter's computer. And when further pressed about whether a mainstream computer user in search of immediate safety from security woes ought to buy Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh instead of a Wintel PC, he said, "If you want to fix it tomorrow, maybe you should buy something else."</blockquote></code></pre>
