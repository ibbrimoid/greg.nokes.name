<blockquote>Enjoy the Superbowl this weekend, but just make sure you don't do it with strangers on a display larger than 55 inches.  If you do, you will be violating the <span class="caps">NFL</span>'s copyrights to the game.  Mass out-of-home viewings at a place where sports viewing is not ordinary business practice goes against the <span class="caps">NFL</span>'s copyrights.

<p>Also, inviting strangers or charging admission (i.e. you're buying the keg) is against the law.</blockquote></p>
