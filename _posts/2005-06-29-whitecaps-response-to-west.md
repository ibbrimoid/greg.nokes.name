<blockquote><span class="caps">WEST</span>: Today my lawyers are filing an appeal to allow the state Supreme Court to review the recall petition filed against me. The citizens of Spokane deserve to know why I have decided to appeal. Simply put, it is because the charges are false, and the ballot statement they would vote on was improperly prepared and is prejudicial.

	<span class="caps">WHITECAPS</span>: If the charges in Shannon Sullivan's recall petition are false, West's lawyers are skilled enough to show that, and the voters of Spokane are intelligent enough to see it. It is West's lawyers' job to make his side of the story known to the electorate who would vote in the recall petition. Questioning the adequacy of the form and content of the ballot is appropriately the duty of the Spokane County Auditor. Putting that question to the State Supreme Court now would be premature since the ballot has yet to be prepared. If the ballot wording is prejudicial, it can be contested once it has been finalized.</blockquote>


	<a href="http://whitecaps.blogspot.com/2005/06/response-to-spokane-mayor-james-west.html">Whitecaps</a> does a very good job of a point by point response to Mayor West's rebuttal and actions over the last few weeks.


	If the Mayor is so certain that he is not guilty and still fit for the job, then he should let the recall go forward. If he is infact still fit for the job, he should not have an issue convincing the voters of that.  However, his actions speak of fear, not confidence.
