<blockquote>According to a University of Minnesota survey in the April issue of the American Sociological Review, atheists are the least trusted minority in the U.S., less trusted than Muslims, recent immigrants and gays and lesbians.

<p>The survey suggests that many Americans still associate atheism with immorality, an association motivated by the old canard that ethics necessarily depends on religion, that you can't be good without God...</p>


<p>..Perhaps most egregiously, atheists (and their children) have suffered at the hands of family courts. In an essay that will appear in the May issue of the New York University Law Review, <span class="caps">UCLA</span> law professor Eugene Volokh provides evidence that courts have discriminated against atheists in custody disputes.</p>


<p>Volokh, who also runs the insightful weblog <a href="http://volokh.com/">The Volokh Conspiracy</a>, documents examples of anti-atheist discrimination in 17 states (including New York, Connecticut, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and many southern states) and the District of Columbia.)</p>
