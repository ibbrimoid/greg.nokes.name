<blockquote>When is the last time you read a real blog entry? An entry that stood on it's own, instead of the 'he said, she said' stuff that goes around? When is the last time you read a weblog where the person who wrote was thinking, and adding to the collective intelligence instead of regurgitating someone else's thoughts by way of hyperlink?

	<p>And bloggers, when is the last time that you wrote something that stood on it's own? When is the last time that you wrote something that didn't hyperlink an agreement or disagreement to someone else's weblog? When is the last time you wrote something that was thought provoking, instead of some dull improvised regurgitation?</p>


	<p>The reason that this is worth thinking about is because the currency of the blogosphere is the 'popular link vote', as determined by <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati </a>and the <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/">Blogshares</a> game</blockquote></p>
