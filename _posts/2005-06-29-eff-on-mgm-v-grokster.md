<blockquote>As many of you know, <span class="caps">EFF</span> represented StreamCast in the <span class="caps">MGM</span> v. Grokster case.  The Supreme Court's decision held that software innovators may be held liable for inducing the copyright infringement of their users.  <span class="caps">EFF</span> believes that the Court unleashed the potential for a torrent of new litigation by creating a test that has many factors, is very fact-specific, and is difficult to predict.  The Court also set us up for a world where consumers are given fewer choices in the marketplace, because innovators will be scared to introduce products that do not have Hollywood's seal of approval.

		<p>There is no question that there will be a flood of litigation as a result of this decision, as well as congressional hearings.  <span class="caps">EFF</span> must be there to represent the rights of innovators and consumers in the fights to come.  Now, more than ever, we need your support to continue to protect innovation and new technologies in cyberspace.</p>
