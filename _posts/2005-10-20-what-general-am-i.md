Like General McClellan, you're smart enough to know what tactical decisions to make. However, the problem with McClellan is that he could never sprout the balls to act on his information, and in the end, that's why Geoge McClellan is only a sidenote in the history books. 
After graduating from West Point, he served with distinction in the Mexican War and later worked on various engineering projects, notably on the survey (1853-54) for a Northern Pacific RR route across the Cascade Range. Resigning from the army in 1857, he was a railroad official until the outbreak of the Civil War. In May, 1861, McClellan was made commander of the Dept. of the Ohio and a major general in the regular army. He cleared the western part of Virginia of Confederates (June-July, 1861) and consequently, after the Union defeat in the first battle of Bull Run, was given command of the troops in and around Washington. In November he became general in chief. The administration, reflecting public opinion, pressed for an early offensive, but McClellan insisted on adequate training and equipment for his army. In Mar., 1862, he was relieved of his supreme command, but he retained command of the Army of the Potomac, with which in Apr., 1862, he initiated the Peninsular campaign . The collapse of this campaign after the Seven Days battles was charged by many to his overcaution. In Aug. 1862, most of McClellan's troops were reassigned to the Army of Virginia under John Pope . After Pope's defeat at the second battle of Bull Run, McClellan again reorganized the Union forces, and in the Antietam campaign he checked Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North. He was slow, however, to follow Lee across the Potomac and in Nov., 1862, was removed from his command. </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"> <img src="http://is0.okcupid.com/users/708/870/7088714327834954884/mt1117655343.jpg"/> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br /><br /><br /> <table cellpadding="20"> <tbody><tr> <td> <span id="comparisonarea">My test tracked 4 variables How you compared to other people <i>your age and gender</i>:<blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4"><tbody><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="12"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="138"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>8%</b> on <b>Unorthodox</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="149"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="1"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>99%</b> on <b>Tactics</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="9"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="141"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>6%</b> on <b>Guts</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle"><table bgcolor="black" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#b2cfff" height="20" width="18"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td><td bgcolor="white" width="132"><a href="http://www.okcupid.com"><img src="http://is3.okcupid.com/graphics/0.gif" alt="free online dating" border="0"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="middle">You scored higher than <b>12%</b> on <b>Ruthlessness</b></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></span> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <table cellpadding=20><tr><td>Link: <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=13827291814577368116'>The Which Historic General Are You Test</a> written by <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=7088714327834954884'>dasnyds</a> on <a href='http://www.okcupid.com'>Ok Cupid</a>, home of the <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/oktest3'>32-Type Dating Test</a></td></tr></table>
