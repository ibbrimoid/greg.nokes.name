<blockquote><center>So whatcha doin' tonight?<br />
Have you heard that the world's gone crazy? <br />
Young Americans listen when I say there's people puttin' us down<br />
I know they're sayin' that we've gone lazy<br />
To tell you the truth we've all seen better days<br />
Don't need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun<br />
Quick trick plans, take the money and run<br />
We need long term, slow burn, getting it done<br />
And some straight talking, hard working son of a gun.<br />
Whatcha doin' tonight, I got faith in our generation<br />
Let's stick together and futurize our attitudes<br />
I ain't lookin' to fight, but I know with determination<br />
We can challenge the schemers who cheat all the rules<br />
Come on take pride, be wise, spottin' the fools<br />
No more big shots, crackpots bending the rules<br />
A fair shot here for me and for you<br />
Knowing that we can't lose<br />

<p>I think that these words ring as true today as they did in 1981 when the album was released. Except, now the people puttin' us down are also blowing us up and have declared war, not on us, but on our way of life.</p>

<p>The enemy does not want to take some of our land, they want to see all of us dead. They want our way of life dead. They want to strangle Ronald McDonald in the street, and behead Jack (of Jack in the Box) in front of a video camera. They want to control what music we listen to, what we wear and how we worship.</p>

<p>Now, as a Buddhist, I am supposed to be against killing. And I am in most cases. However, I feel that defense of my family's life, of my freedom and of the freedom of my country people is a worthy cause. I salute the men and women that are on the front lines , giving up their holiday time with their family's to defend us, and to help another people realize the freedom that we all deserve.</p>

<p>As a people, we must approach the rest of the world with compassion, and a iron fist in a velvet glove. When we need to hit, it must be hard, precise and with out remorse. However, when the iron fist is not the answer, we have to start actually helping the rest of the world. We cannot continue our ways of funding extremists who happen to be fighting our enemy at the time. If there is a famine, we need to assist as the richest country in the world can. We need stop propping up governments and companies, and start dealing with the problems at home. We need to behave less like codependent parents and more like a good friend.</p>
