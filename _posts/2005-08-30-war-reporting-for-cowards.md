In <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4823346"> War Reporting for Cowards</a> NPR does a really interesting radio report about Chris Ayres, a self-described "neurotic, Gen-X hypochondriac," who ended up embedded in a Marine unit during the invasion of Iraq. He details out some of the hardships that he faced - like picking out a tent. A must listen!
