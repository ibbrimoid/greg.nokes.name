<blockquote>America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. That was the conclusion of the 2002 U.S. National Security Strategy. For a country whose foreign policy in the 20th century was dominated by the struggles against powerful states such as Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union, the U.S. assessment is striking. Nor is the United States alone in diagnosing the problem. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned that ignoring failed states creates problems that sometimes come back to bite us. French President Jacques Chirac has spoken of the threat that failed states carry for the world's equilibrium. World leaders once worried about who was amassing power; now they worry about the absence of it.</blockquote>

	It’s interesting how our foreign policy’s success has now turned on us.

	For example – Most of the former <span class="caps">USSR</span> is shown as ‘borderline’ or worse on the map provided. Many of the battlegrounds of the cold war are probably worse off for the wear.

	The choices made in the past effect us now. It does us no good to second guess what we did – but we should look at the results and see what our aggressive and expansionistic policies  have reaped.

	I agree that the destabilized areas of the world are where trouble is going to brew. In this day and age, when the US alone out spends the entire world in military spending (notice how they call it defense spending? What is up with that? If we spend more on our defense then everyone else put together, are we paranoid?) no one can stand toe to toe with us anymore. There is no battlefield that any one (or two or ten) country can defeat us on.

	So, people who rebel against our mass-marketed culture take to the back alleys, the coffee shops. The meet and talk, and the really whacked out ones strap bombs on and blow themselves up in pointless gestures of defiance and misplaced rage.

	The suicide bombers worry me – but the smart ones scare me. The ones that are actively plotting to destroy our culture and, it seems at times, are winning. These are the ones that talk the whacked out ones into their path of destruction. The Imams and Clerics that preach the radicalized version of Islam. The ones that create and spread the really toxic memes.

	I believe that violence will only beget more violence. I do not think that guns will solve this – talking will. But how do you convince some one that thinks your entire belief system and way of live is a puss-filled ulcer on a otherwise godly earth that they are wrong? How do you teach them tolerance? Can you? Should you even try, or should you just take the short term solution, the quick fix?

	I do not pretend to have the answer to these questions. I question our current policy, however I do not have any better ideas. Talking is not an option, as they believe that we will simple lie to them. Money is not an option, as many of them come from well off families.

	There are no easy solutions.
