Is faith allergic to sunlight? If you cannot even question it with out breaking it, how strong is it?

<p>My belief structure morphs over time - because I work it out. I pull it, twist it, and stretch it. It has not broken in a since I lost my faith in God. It was brittle and hard, and now it's elastic and strong. It just changes when presented with a new idea, or a new way of looking at something.</p>


<p>I do not believe something because I read it or I am told it - I believe it because it makes logical and reasonable sense to me. I accept outside sources when I have several trusted authorities that corroborate each other. Or I try it. It's that simple. Meditation is good for mental stability say the Buddhists. I do not believe them, so I try it. Guess what, they are right. Good old empirical evidence.</p>


<p>My belief is based on reasoning. True, it's the limited reasoning that I am capable of, but we have to work with the tools that we are given. If some one wants to be a Christian, I applaud them for their faith. Christianity has some really good teachings. However, I believe that they should know what they believe and why. Circular logical and superstition is not knowing what and why - it's taking the easy road out of the valley.</p>


<p>When it comes down to it, one side said says '<em>it's true because I believe it and I believe it because it says it's True</em>' and the other side is asking '<em>why do you believe it, why is it true?</em>'. There is a huge disconnect in fundamental thinking between the two. One argument is grounded in reason, logic and evidence. The other is using superstition, tradition and blind faith. The problem is when the faith based folks also feel that they have the <strong>only</strong> truth available. They are not willing to allow others to believe differently then they do, or act differently then what they think is 'correct'.</p>


<p>If you have faith, and you cannot even defend it with out dropping back on '<em>its true because I believe it</em>', should you be making moral choices for others? My concern is that a lot of people are trying to force their faith based moral choices on the rest of us. They feel that they have a manifest destiny to do this. Their faith gives them this manifest destiny. They might be a minority, but they are very vocal, and they are pushing legislation based on their black and white world-view.</p>


<p>For example, does it really hurt someone to allow the Marriage of two people who love each other? According to some, it causes grievous harm in certain circumstances. So much harm that there are constitutional amendments being proposed that stop this from happening in these cases. This is an example of civil penalties for not following the faith based belief system of a certain religion. They do this because feel that they have a monopoly on <em>Truth</em>, and anyone who disagrees with their version of <em>Truth</em> is a sinner or heretic.</p>


<p>In every part of life we accept that the world is not black and white, except religion. I have been told by preachers and priests that '<em>if you're not with us, you are against us</em>'. That is the kind of sick thinking that I try and debunk. And, yes, it's <strong>sick</strong>. It's a mimetic virus that is trying to make sure that it survives in a global survival of the fittest ideas war.</p>


<p>What the people carrying this disease fail to understand is this war will only be lost.</p>
