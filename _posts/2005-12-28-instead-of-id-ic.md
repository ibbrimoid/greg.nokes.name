<blockquote>ID vs. IC: what is the distinction? Simply put, Intelligent Design posits that the universe needs a cause, but that the cause is a creature who designs and plans like a limited human being (but with supernatural powers), and this creature appeared from nowhere (by accident?) and needs no cause or creator of its own (the 'first causeâ€ idea). Infinite Causes, on the other hand, is so named because of the belief that there are an infinite number of causes and conditions that made the world the way it is. There is no 'first cause' or 'one cause' because all things are intertwined in an endless web of causality with no beginning and no end. Both natural and supernatural forces may be involved.</blockquote>

If the ID proponents want ID taught in school - then we certainly should include alternate theories of the creation of the universe. This is one of them.


A lot of the argument for ID seems to hinge on two points:
<ol>
    <li>Life is too complex to have emerged on it's own</li>
    <li>The universe is too finely tuned to our needs to have happened by random chance</li>
</ol>
As far as point 2 goes - IC states:
<blockquote>According to some cosmologists, the universe began as a quantum fluctuation in the limitless Void (Hartle Hawking cosmology). In the absence of an observer, the evolving universe remained as a 'multiverse' - a coherant quantum superposition of all logically possible states...

...<a href="http://home.btclick.com/scimah/Quantumphenomena.htm">Quantum theory</a> states that any physical system remains in a superposed state of all possibilities until it interacts with the mind of an observer. Both quantum theory and Buddhist teachings on <a href="http://home.btclick.com/scimah/sunyata.htm">sunyata</a> suggest that as soon as an observer's mind makes contact with a superposed system, all the numerous possibilities collapse into one actuality. At some instant one of these possible alternative universes produced an observing lifeform - an animal with a nervous system which was sufficiently evolved to form <a href="http://home.btclick.com/scimah/Symbioticmind.htm">a symbiotic association   with a primordial mind.</a> The first act of observation by this mind caused the entire superposed multiverse to collapse immediately into one of its numerous alternatives.


That one alternative version of the multiverse was not just the first configuration to be inhabitable by mind. The fact that it was the <strong>first</strong> configuration also   guaranteed that it was the<strong> only</strong> configuration. All uninhabited alternative universes, ranging from the nearly-but-not-quite habitable few, to the anarchic and unstructured vast majority, were instantly excluded from potential existence. According to the participatory anthopic principle the evolving multiverse was thus always destined to resolve itself into a sufficiently ordered state to allow itself to be observed.</blockquote>
So, according to this theory, the universe is the way it is because it was observed to be the way it is. Thus, the universe is completely suited to life's existence - down to <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/planck-s-constant?method=8">Planck's constant</a>. Which, if it was off by more then a few hundredths of a percent would not have allowed matter to form.


It's an interesting thought!
