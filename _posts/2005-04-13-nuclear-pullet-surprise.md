<blockquote>A once secret plan to build a nuclear landmine 'run' by live chickens has gone on public display for the first time at The National Archives, Kew, as part of the acclaimed Secret State Exhibition.</blockquote>

You can read the rest <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2005/04/nuclear_pullet_.html">here</a>, but it boils down to this. They were going to stuff a nuclear landmine full of chickens to insure that the weapon's important parts did not get too cold and freeze up during the winter.


Leave it to the human race to come up with an idea this unique.


I don't know if I am amazed by our resourcefullness or sickened.
