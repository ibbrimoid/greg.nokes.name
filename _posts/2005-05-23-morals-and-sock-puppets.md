<p><a href="http://davejustus.blogspot.com/">Dave</a> ruminates on his blog:</p>


	<blockquote>    <em>Can an individual action be morally wrong if it is entirely private and no-one, not even the person doing the act, is harmed by it at all?</em>

	<p>This statement is really the meat of this survey. I answered yes here. Not doing harm is, in my mind anyway, the beginning point, not the ending of morality.</blockquote></p>


	<p>I would like to see a action that does no harm to anyone, is private, and is immoral. I personally do not feel that can exist.</p>


	<p>Morality (in my ever so humble opinion) is part culture, part personal. There is no natural law of morality that says X shall always be immoral. If you were to belive in that, then there would have to be some mechinism for acts that had never been considered before to be measured against some natural moral stick.</p>


	<p>For example, the first creature that masterbated - this was an act that have never happened before. Now, at that moment, it would have had to be decided if that act was moral or not. That takes a choice to be made. That takes some sort consciousness.</p>


	<p>Dave also says:</p>


	<blockquote>    <em>Do you think that morality comes from God or some other source outside of nature, society and human judgement?</em>

	<p>I answered no here, as should be unsurprising given my previous explanations. If morality is defined as the best possible choice, than it is a thing into and of itself, so it would arrise from nature.</blockquote></p>


	<p>However, for there to be some natural law of morality - there has to be a God or God like force that adjudicates it. So these anwsers contradict each other.</p>


	<p>Morality is either decided by the culture and the people in the culture or it is given down from on high. There is no middle road here.</p>
