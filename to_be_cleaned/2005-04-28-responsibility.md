<blockquote>Earlier this year, when Major League Baseball questioned Congress' right to hold public hearings on steroid use in the big leagues, Government Reform Committee Chairman Tom Davis (R-Va.) and ranking minority member Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) sent back a striking response. Davis and Waxman told baseball that the committee "may at any time conduct investigations of any matter."

<p>Any time. Any matter. And this from the congressional committee charged with curbing government excesses.</blockquote></p>

<p>I think this brings up a valid point. Where do we draw the line? At what point do we tell the government to stop running our lives for us.</p>


<p>I think that we are seeing is the progression of the Christian Culture of non-personal responsibility. If your faith tells you that your transgressions will be forgiven by some guy behind the curtain, what will happen when that seeps into real life?</p>


<p>'<em>Give your life to God</em>'</p>


<p>People are always looking for a way to take the pressure of living life off their backs. They want to  let some one else take over for them. Often Christians tell me to 'Give my life to God'. God will make my life better - easier - less painful.</p>


<p>I want to run my own life. I want to be ultimately responsible for my actions. If I choose a life of Evil, I do not want to be forgiven at the end, and I want the rewards of a good life to come my way.  If I do make it to heaven, or what ever, I really do not want to see folks like Hitler there, simply because he asked for forgiveness.</p>


<p>It is easy transformation from allowing God to make choices for you to allowing the Government to make all the hard choices for you.</p>


<p><em>You can't eat that because it's bad for you.</em></p>


<p>Yesterday, while I was driving, I switched to <a href="http://www.newstalk590.com/main.html">590 Talk Radio </a> and heard a segment where the 'talker' was exploring the possibly of a law suit vs Sesame Street because the Cookie Monster scarred him as a child - and made him into a cookie addict. It was in jest, but the point remains. When we espouse a culture of personal un-responsibility, we loose in many ways.</p>


<blockquote>Consider your pet. Surely Fido or Mittens is immune from government scrutiny, right? Nope. San Francisco passed a new building code earlier this year-for doghouses. In case you were considering a pair of double-Ds for your schipperke, West Hollywood, Calif. is considering a law that would ban cosmetic surgery for pets. And the state of California has banned genetically modified fish in your aquarium.</blockquote>

<p>In the end, I feel that we should be held accountable for our choices and our actions. If we choose to eat McDonald's every day, and we end up weighing in at 450+, that is our fault - not McDonald's.</p>


<p>If we have the money, and want to pay for Cosmetic Surgery for our pet, that is our choice.</p>


<p>Power to the People!</p>
