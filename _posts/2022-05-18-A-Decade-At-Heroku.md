At about 7:45am March 26th 2011, I walked up to the doors at Heroku for the first time. I was early because _that's what you did_ where I came from.

The doors were locked. No one responded to the buzzer.

So I went and got some really bad coffee at the DNA Lounge next door, and waited. As I recall, I saw someone walk in at about 9, and followed them in. And that's how the next chapter in my life started.

<!--more-->

I got my start in technology far before it was "tech". My first exposure was working on a NetWare 3 network running ARCNet. Look it up, I'll wait.

In the 90's I got to work on NetWare 2, 3, and 4. Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT 3.5, 3.51, and 4. ARCNet, Token Ring, ThickNet _and_ ThinNet, CAT3, CAT5 and Fibre. I built early internet proxies and ran WAN's that served 1,000's of users with file and print services. I was firmly grounded as a BOFH.

However I saw greater potential. I ended up getting hired as a contractor to help the US Department of Justice and then the US Department of Homeland Security run their network in Washington State. I spent 8 great years there, building data centers and coding.

After 8 years however, I started to doubt the mission, and did not feel like I was able to actually have any impact beyond keeping things running. So I started to look outside of government service, and back towards working in the "real world"

I ended up spending time at places like Engine Yard, Point Inside, and Bluebox Group. These were early cloud based companies - either providers like EY and BBG or consumers like Point Inside. I really started to value "the cloud", and the agility that it could bring me as someone with a sysadmin background.

All of that lead to me standing outside Heroku's door on that early SF morning, wondering if I had made the right choice. Little did I know how much I would learn over the next decade.
