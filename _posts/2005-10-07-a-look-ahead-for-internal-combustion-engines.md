<blockquote>But it is no accident that the U.S. Department of Energy and other organizations are focusing most of their research on diesel and <span class="caps">HCCI</span> engines.</blockquote>

	<p>Looks like the <span class="caps">DOE</span> and others agree with me - Diesel is the technology that we need to invest in for the short term goals.</p>


	<p>Just look at it this way - what powers the majority of our transportation system? Diesel trucks and trains. Making them even a little more efficient will garner great gains.</p>


	<p>Willy Nelson has circumstantial evidence posted that show a 40% increase in efficiency when you switch to BioDiesel (5 mpg to 7 mpg) (<a href="http://www.wnbiodiesel.com/customers.html">Willie Nelson's  Biodiesel</a>). <span class="caps">A 40</span>% increase in fuel efficiency would be a huge savings for the transportation sector.</p>


	<p>Last year, we averaged <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/quickfacts/quickoil.html">382.4 million gallons</a> of fuel a day. At the current average price of $3.00 a gallon, we are spending in the range of $1,152 milllion a day on fuel. Over 60% of that is spent by the transportation sector. So, they are spending $690 million a day on fuel. Cut that 40% and we get over $270 million a <span class="caps">DAY</span> saved. That's $98.5 billion a year in savings. We could pay for the biofuel refineries in one year, just off of the savings.</p>


	<p>Close on the horizon is the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hcci+engine&#38;sourceid=mozilla-search&#38;start=0&#38;start=0&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;client=firefox&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial"><span class="caps">HCCI</span></a> engine - a next generation diesel engine that is even cleaner and more efficient then standard diesel engines.</p>
